# 100 Days Of Code - Log


### Day 0: January 1, 2021 Friday

**Today's Progress**: Started the shopify developer internship challenge. Created a react app. Hoping to incorporate Fuse React for search functionality.

**Thoughts:** Im feeling pretty nervous about coding. Its been a little over a month since graduation and I am looking forward to get back into learning. Im happy about the structure of 100 days of coding. Let's go!

**Successes** Got the repo and dependencies downloaded. Starting building the header and search components.

**Quote of the day:** "The brain is like a muscle. When it is in use we feel very good. Understanding is joyous" -Carl Sagan

### Day 1: January 2, 2020 Saturday

**Today's Progress** Today went well. Polaris is very well documented. Learning more and keep coding!

**Thoughts** Looking into polaris today. Shopify's react framework. Signed up with Shopify Developers. Polaris is very well documented.

**Successes** Installed dependencies and started psuedo coding how I want this to work and look.


### Day 2: January 3, 2020 Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Worked for a couple hours today. It's nice getting back into the groove of things. Today I learned more about Polaris and am fighting with my React App to pull in what it needs. Computer froze for two hours. So it goes. 

**Thoughts** Learning more about Polaris. Its like a basket that I am trying to unweave. In order to get a search bar you have to have a frame, in order to have a frame you have to have a model. What is this sorcery? 

**Successes** Figured how to pull in different components. Polaris needs some help to streamline this. Pick me!

**Quote of the day:** "Its kind of fun to do the impossible" -Walt Disney


### Day 3: January 4, 2020 Monday

**Today's Progress** Kept running into a "out of memory" error when I tried running my polaris react app. Added "@babel/core": "^7.7.7" to my devDependencies in my package.json to get around the error. I worked with CSS to begin manipulating the page, a good foundation. I read into what Shopify expects in a challenge like this and I have settled on "Reasons why I want to work at Shopify." My plan is to pull in a API from a Canadian Image source. I'm thinking Shopify will enjoy the humor. 

**Thoughts** Now that I finally have a grasp of the direction I want to take this challenge I am looking forward to learning more about APIs tomorrow. Today set me up for success for my next plan of attack. 

**Successes** Today I was successful in debugging the 'out of memory' error. I also began working with css and importing homemade components.  


### Day 4: January 5, 2020 Tuesday

**Today's Progress** API work today. Started my API.js. Finding a good API was the hardest past of today. I bet a lot of people will be using the placekitten or puppy APIs. My intention is to do something that sets me apart. I signed up as a developer with unsplash but they want two weeks to review my need for a API key. Onto the next thing. Maybe dogs are where its at. 

**Successes** I was successful in getting my app ready for the unsplash API only to find out that it takes them two weeks to review. So Ill have to switch gears tomorrow with my API.js to work with the damn dog API. 


### Day 5: January 6, 2020 Wednesday

**Today's Progress** Took today off. Today Trump supporters stormed the Capitol. Im speechless. 


### Day 6: January 7, 2020 Thursday

**Today's Progress** Made great strides today. Figured out how to upload an image to cloudinary using react. 

**Thoughts** I asked the right questions today which makes all the difference. Worked for three hours today. It felt good getting obsessed again. Also I got the TA job today! Yay!

**Successes** Linked my react app to cloudinary for successful uploading. 


### Day 7: January 8, 2020 Friday

**Today's Progress** Banging my head against my computer today. Spent three hours trying to figure out how to map through all my cloudinary images uploaded through my app. I cant figure it out!

**Thoughts** There isn't good documentation on functional components and cloudinary. Trying really hard not to delete everything and start over using class components. Ive tried cloudinary-react, fetch, axios, 

**Successes** Nope. Nope. Nope. Spent nine hours today and made very little actual progress. Learned a lot about react and cloudinary. 



### Day 8: January 9, 2020 Saturday

**Today's Progress** Began everything from scratch. Apparently I need to access a database in order to pull the images from cloudinary. Again, not happy about that documentation. Spent most of today trying to incorporate a webpack. Very unsuccessful I might add. 

**Thoughts** Annoyed to start over. Ive spent a lot of time on what I do have but I cant figure out how to incorporate routes with what I have. 

**Successes** Successfully recognized that I have no idea what Im doing and am super frustrated. 


### Day 9: January 10, 2020 Sunday

**Today's Progress** I BROKE IT! Spent the day trouble shooting what the issue is. I still dont know. 

**Thoughts** Banging my head against the table. I dont know what to do. 


### Day 10: January 11, 2020 Monday

**Today's Progress** Ive deleted the package-lock and node modules twice today. It takes my computer over 30 minutes to complete this. Im beyond frustrated. Even after deleting and reinstalling it wont run. Error: Cannot find webpack module. EVEN THOUGH I TOLD IT TO DOWNLOAD IN THE DEVDEPENDENCIES! 



### Day 11: January 12, 2020 Tuesday

**Today's Progress** Today I was supposed to attend the Shopify Internship Webinar. But I never got the access code. Great start to my morning. I deleted the package lock and node modules one last time! And now its running. Couldn't tell ya what was different this time other than my emotional chaos today. 

**Thoughts** Coding is frustrating. I know what Im doing here. And its just not responding properly.  Why is adding a webpack causing so much trouble? Cant get the cloudinary openUploadWidget to work. Spending the rest of today researching that. Ive spent 6 hours 'coding' today. 

**Successes** Got my second job offer today from UW! Feeling good about it. Was able to add the webpack and get it running. Phew. That took forever! Now onto build this app!

8 hours later. I fixed it! App is up and running. Styling tomorrow and lets be done already!


### Day 12: January 13, 2020 Wednesday

**Today's Progress** Started using CSS to manipulate the page. This is always the hardest part for me. I don't know what kinds of things look good, I dont really have an eye for it. So here goes nothing. 

**Thoughts** I hate CSS


### Day 13: January 14, 2020 Thursday

**Today's Progress** ER today. Took the day off due to memory loss. 


### Day 14: January 15, 2020 Friday

**Today's Progress** Added polaris components today. Page, TopBar, FooterHelp, and Link. 

**Thoughts** I'll be done and deployed tomorrow. Looking forward to learning something new. 



### Day 15: January 16, 2020 Saturday

**Today's Progress** Deployed to github. I had forgotten that github cant display outside the root folder. Need to deploy via heroku. Running into issues with deploying to heroku. "Invalid: lock file's react-scripts@4.0.1 does not satisfy react-scripts@0.9.5" Downloading react-scripts@0.9.5 into dependencies to see if that will fix it. <--DONT DO THAT, BROKE IT! I reset the HEAD and am trying to figure out what Heroku needs. Deleted package-lock and reinstalled dependencies to get the app to run again. Still not having luck deploying. I added the mars/create and nodejs buildpacks, deleted the package-lock and reinstalled only to find that the steps I took earlier dug me deeper in a hole. I removed the react-scripts@0.9.5 and reinstalled everything and got it to run again. 

My next task was to use postman to figure out why my axios request wasn't pulling any data. After four hours I figured it out. I was using https instead of http. 

Then I began using css to manipulate the images now that they were rendering. 

When I deployed the changes I got this error "xhr.js:177 Mixed Content: The page at 'https://shopify-internship-challenge.herokuapp.com/' was loaded over HTTPS, but requested an insecure XMLHttpRequest endpoint 'http://res.cloudinary.com/kaylanewlon/image/list/ShopifyInternshipChallenge.json'. This request has been blocked; the content must be served over HTTPS."  So back to square one. Heroku needs the 's'. 

I found a stackoverflow that said to take out the http all together and just use //'url'. Trying that now. Yup! That works! I have a deployed app and functioning app! 

**Thoughts** Spent 8 hours coding today. I feel super accomplished. 

**Successes** Figured out why my axios wasn't returning data, fixed the error. Deployed to heroku. Began using css on what the axios request is rendering. Very successful day debugging and correcting errors. 


### Day 16: January 17, 2020 Sunday

**Today's Progress** SHOPIFY APPLICATION DUE
Things to look at: when the widget is opened you have to upload an image. You cant click the 'X' to close it. It is looking for a response. 

Done, deployed. https://shopify-internship-challenge.herokuapp.com/
**Thoughts** Add comments, Add logo and quirky repo name. Decided on "2020 It Wasn't All Bad"

**Successes** 
White nav, shopify logo upper left hand corner. Add favicon. Footer, bottom right. 

### Day 17: January 18, 2020 Monday

**Today's Progress** Started and finished the React JS crash course through Traversy Media. Created a Task Tracker application with React and a JSON-server. 
Completed repo: https://github.com/kbnewlon/react-task-tracker

**Thoughts** Loved his tutorial. Great pace and very well explained. I'll be looking more into his online learning materials. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7ejDZ8SWv8&ab_channel=TraversyMedia


### Day 18: January 19, 2020 Tuesday

**Today's Progress** Started a netflix-clone app with React, Material-UI, Firebase, and TMDB API. Used axios to pull in the data. Began creating components. Tutorial by Clever Programmers. https://youtu.be/XtMThy8QKqU

### Day 20: January 21, 2020 Thursday

**Today's Progress** Started the Google Books Search application with React. 

**Thoughts** After my week of react tutorials I felt pretty good about starting this app. 

**Successes** I started with making it react and setting up the file structure. Then I set up preliminary components, routes, models, and controllers. More tomorrow!
