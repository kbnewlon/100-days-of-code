# 100 Days Of Code - Log


### Day 0: January 1, 2021 Friday

**Today's Progress**: Started the shopify developer internship challenge. Created a react app, using material-ui. Hoping to incorporate Fuse React for search functionality.

**Thoughts:** Im feeling pretty nervous about coding. Its been a little over a month since graduation and I am looking forward to get back into learning. Im happy about the structure of 100 days of coding. Let's go!
