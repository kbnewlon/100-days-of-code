# 100 Days Of Code - Log


### Day 0: January 1, 2021 Friday

**Today's Progress**: Started the shopify developer internship challenge. Created a react app. Hoping to incorporate Fuse React for search functionality.

**Thoughts:** Im feeling pretty nervous about coding. Its been a little over a month since graduation and I am looking forward to get back into learning. Im happy about the structure of 100 days of coding. Let's go!

**Successes** Got the repo and dependencies downloaded. Starting building the header and search components.

### Day 1: January 2, 2020 Saturday

**Today's Progress** Today went well. Polaris is very well documented. Learning more and keep coding!

**Thoughts** Looking into polaris today. Shopify's react framework. Signed up with Shopify Developers. Polaris is very well documented.

**Successes** Installed dependencies and started psuedo coding how I want this to work and look.


### Day 2: January 3, 2020 Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Worked for a couple hours today. It's nice getting back into the groove of things. Today I learned more about Polaris and am fighting with my React App to pull in what it needs. Computer froze for two hours. So it goes. 

**Thoughts** Learning more about Polaris. Its like a basket that I am trying to unweave. In order to get a search bar you have to have a frame, in order to have a frame you have to have a model. What is this sorcery? 

**Successes** Figured how to pull in different components. Polaris needs some help to streamline this. Pick me!
